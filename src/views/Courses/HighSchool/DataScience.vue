    overviewTitle="Data Science for High School"
    overviewParagraph1="is a beginner-friendly course designed to build a strong foundation in both Python programming and the core mathematical concepts essential for data science and machine learning. Students will begin by mastering programming fundamentals—such as data structures, functions, classes, and debugging—before moving into foundational topics in statistics, calculus, and linear algebra."
    overviewParagraph2="Emphasizing a hands-on, practical approach, the course integrates popular Python libraries used in real-world data analysis. Students will reinforce their learning through interactive exercises, homework, and supplementary tutorials, all supported by weekly mentoring sessions that offer personalized guidance and collaborative practice. A team-based capstone project provides the opportunity to apply newly acquired skills to solve meaningful, real-world Python challenges."
    overviewParagraph3="By the end of the course, students will have both the technical fluency and mathematical intuition needed to tackle introductory machine learning coursework and embark on independent data analytics projects with confidence. It's the perfect launchpad for aspiring data scientists and AI enthusiasts."
